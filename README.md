# DX2-Setup_LS

Everyone likes to have their ls perform a certain way.. right?

At least, I do. I like my ls to be ran with a particular set of options, and I like to
have a particular set of ls aliases set up with each one, ran with its particular set
of options.

So I figure since I am that anal, then there must be someone else out there who is too

.... right ??? Cause... It'd be pretty sad if I was the only one.

Anyways... So I made this for those out there who don't know how to set up their ls 
command.

This script will delete all the ls aliases that comes with .bashrc, get the user to pick
all the options they want to be enabled by default when ls is launched, and then create 
a new ls alias with all those options included.

You can create as many different ls aliases as you want.
